# My New Portfolio
This project will combine aspects from my React personal portfolio with my cse134_hw5 

## Design
I started off creating a basic layout of what I wanted in my personal portfolio. 

### Pages
I decided that I would have 4 different pages:
`home, about, portfolio, resume`
and combine previous ideas I had into these 4 pages. I removed the contact form because I don't think it will have much impact I wanted.

I have added images of layouts in the layout folder with the pdf.
